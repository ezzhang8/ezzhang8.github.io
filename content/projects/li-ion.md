## Summary
We had the incredible opportunity to conduct lithium-ion battery research on the synchrotron beamlines of the Canadian Light Source in Saskatoon, as part of the renowned [Students on the Beamline](https://www.lightsource.ca/public/ed/programs/students-on-the-beamline.php) program.

In brainstorming research project ideas, I floated studying the degradation of lithium ion batteries, as clean energy and the rise of EVs were really hot topics these past years.

We sourced our sample batteries from a connection at Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and another set from local Burnaby startup Nano One Materials (TSX: NANO). The batteries used different manufacturing processes and chemistry, giving us an opportunity to identify differences in ion distributions post-cycling. 

This research project was much larger than just my individual contributions. Check out the video below for the full presentation.

Here's a snippet of the poster we released that summarizes much of the results! [View the full poster here](https://event.fourwaves.com/clsaum-22/abstracts/9d972f16-8796-4dbd-b14c-2b3609e7e769/poster).
