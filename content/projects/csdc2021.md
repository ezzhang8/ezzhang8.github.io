## Overview

We put an infrared camera into a soda can form factor, and launched it from the sky over Abbotsford airport, taking pictures on the way down.
I'd probably be repeating a lot of details verbatim from one source, so please check out the post published in [Teledyne FLIR's blog](https://www.flir.ca/discover/cores-components/students-win-first-ever-canadian-cansat-competition-with-design-incorporating-flir-lepton/), for all the details on this exciting project!
