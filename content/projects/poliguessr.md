I took all the precincts from the 2024 election, picked coordinates within them, and recorded the vote tallies for that precinct. This game picks a random one of those to quiz you! 
Can you guess, just from street imagery, how a neighborhood voted?

Heavily inspired by the [NYT's version](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/upshot/trump-biden-geography-quiz.html) for the 2020 election. 

Made with open-source data from 21MetcalfJ and the NYTimes.
