## Overview
After a successful CanSat (can shaped mini 'satellite') mission last year, I again took the technical lead on a new CanSat project. We couldn't use the same mission idea again, so we got the idea to measure ionizing radiation.

We attended a in-person launch in Lethbridge, Alberta. I am writing this a bit after the event, so here's some contemporary media coverage of what we did!
